		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My name is Tyler Thompson and I am the founder of New Pointe, LLC.
		I have been interested in developing a new and improved Noodle system for many years as I discovered a need in the industry during my tenure as a technician/installer. 
		<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Over the past 5 years, I encountered many inferior systems with defects and deficiencies including but not limited to retrievers breaking, hooks disassembling, etc. As an experienced technician, I was convinced there had to be a better way. The Patent Pending New Pointe Noodle system is the culmination of many years of design, testing and inventing an improved product.
		<br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp We are a small family run business located in Salt Lake City, Utah. New Point, LLC has been operating as a business for just over 5 years.
		I hope you enjoy your visit to our website and that you have you have found the information helpful. We look forward to working with you.
		<br>Thank Youâ€¨, Tyler Thompson
